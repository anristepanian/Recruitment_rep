"Douglas Henry has not performed at a high level while working here. He constantly argues with all of the customers, and is disrespectful to all of his coworkers. He has a hard time showing up on time, and shows a lack of skill on all tasks. Taking all of these things into consideration, he is a liability to the company.",0
"Freddie Davies onboarded the team a few months ago and has been having some difficulty fulfilling his assigned tasks. Partially completing his work with less than satisfactory quality, Freddie has some room for improvement. He's missed business unit meetings on multiple occasions and seems to have had some difficulty in maintaining good working relationships with some of his co-workers. I think Freddie should listen to feedback from others to help him improve on his work performance going forward.",0
Freddie Davies needs lots of improvement in his work. He was not able to meet the given deadlines.Though he is a hard worker there are many areas he need to work in to do better in his results.He needs to focus on details and try to meet his targets with efficiency,0
Broderick is not doing so well. His work on a daily basis is consistently poor. He also shows only a limited capacity for improving or growing beyond his current role. He may simply not be a suitable fit for this organization.,0
"Broderick is always such a wildcard to put in front of a client since he always seems to have something crass to say, even to some of our most respected clients. I'm not confident that he can ever grow up and become the professional that we're looking for him to be. I understand that he's only recently graduated from college but he has no interest in implementing any of the advice he's been given from our one-on-one meetings. Moreover, the work he turns in to me is consistently sloppy and riddled with errors.",0
"Mackenzie needs to improve in all areas if she wishes to stay with the organization. Her day-to-day work is generally sloppy and her attitude is poor. She doesn't show much interest in growing or improving her skills, either. Though it may sound harsh, she is proving with every passing day that she is more of a liability to the company than an asset.",0
Carson Vargas is not showing he can complete tasks to a good level. His work has been of poor quality so far. We have seen that he is struggling to complete his work to a satisfactory level. With help he can hope to look to the future for better output.,0
"Andy was a very inconsistent player, he would be on his day once every two month.
He was one of the lowest performance colleague I've had.
Fairness to him, he probably gave his best but he didn't have great potential.",0
Very poor and deficient capacity for analysis and value judgments. You have a very bad spelling in your document writing You did not comply with the times established in the delivery of the entrusted activities No type of creativity is observed in the work carried out,0
"Jaiden Horne onboarded to our Business Intelligence team a few months ago. He has been struggling since starting here, and I'm a little concerned with how he might do in the upcoming quarters. This quarter, he has been assigned a handful of duties but has only completed about half of them, with the other half being partially completed or not attended to yet. I have noticed that sometimes he is not in the office space and has been late or has not showed up to his unit's business meetings on multiple occasions.",0
Katherine Terry has much to learn. We have not seen high quality work from her so far. At present there is much for her to improve on. We hope she can continue to improve for the sake of her work.,0
"Tom Barrett has consistently shown that he is not fit, nor has the desire to improve, for his position at our company. Since day one, the work that he turns in has been poor, riddled with mistakes, and often has to be redone by another team member. Barrett also has a problem with showing up to work on time, overstaying his lunch breaks, and last minute sick call outs. It may be best that Barrett does not move forward with our company.",0
"Amoy has not improved in her personality to handle the customer service aspect of her job. She does not over-achieve on anything, as  a matter of fact I believe that she is only here to get a paycheck and this is not good for the company, especially in the position of a front-desk receptionist. I also feel that she is  a high performer of watching the clock. It would benefit the company to write her up to see if any improvement.",0
Jalen Summers does not fit the guidelines we expect and strive for in this company. He is often unhappy in the workplace and shows distaste in the work he is given. He often leaves his shift early and does not answer calls. His performance has significantly decreased in the last quarter. I can only hope for this issue to be resolved soon.,0
"Kohen doesn't appear to love this job, like other employees show. Kohen is always goofing around and not being serious. Kohen appears to have good intentions, but fails to bring it to the table. Kohen needs to show more effort in his job performance.",0
Wade Stanley was late to work for the 3rd time this week. He comes into work out of dress code most days. It's not uncommon for him to leave earlier than he is scheduled to. Many days he isn't very friendly and sometimes even hostile towards his fellow co workers and clients. It is important we review if he is truly the type of person this company needs. We can only assume he is asking to be fired.,0
"Addison is consistently sloppy in her work. I always need to remind her to proofread and copy-edit the reports that she drafts and she never remembers these instructions, so I need to keep reminding her repeatedly. Her colleagues have reported that she tries to pass off a lot of work to them since she gets easily overwhelmed with even basic research assignments. I don't believe that Addison can make many improvements, since she seems unwilling and unable to follow directions and gets too stressed about the simplest tasks.",0
"Sonny has a charming personality. He gets along very well with customers, and they seem to enjoy his service. His sales numbers, in fact, are somewhat impressive. However, he is currently lacking motivation. His coworkers often keep busy by cleaning their work station or catching up on emails, meanwhile Sonny plays on his phone or slacks off in other ways. His mind is clearly not on the job, which is not ideal for someone in his position. He doesn't seem to take his job seriously.",0
"Amaya has been completing all the tasks she has been assigned to. Even though she completes her work in a timely manner, the quality of her work is mediocre and can be improved. She doesn't go the extra mile on certain projects or requests. If she is able to improve her work ethnic, then maybe the quality of her work will reflect that too. She will better position herself for a promotion if she can demonstrate a stronger work ethnic.",0
Brynlee Byers has much to offer in his work. He gives consistent importance to the tasks set for him by the team. At times his lack of talent has let him down. This could be improved with a more hands on approach.,0
"Elliot is fairly effective at managing his workload. He has been a consistent team member. Though, he has not sought help to achieve better results. He needs initiative to become one of our rising stars.",0
Emerson Rose becomes the quality worker she needs to be when finishing tasks. She has much to learn and has not shown the talent required. That being said she continues to excel. Her tasks completion has been at times good quality.,0
"Jayden Rees always gives creative and intuitive feedback during team meetings. Her input were very insightful and original with some good thinking to back up. However, she has shown decreased interest and motivation at her assigned tasks lately and seems to wander off during office hour more often. Her work were actually decent and satisfactory.",0
"Amelie Martin finished her assigned tasks on time most of the time. She often asked for an extension for her deadlines and returns with normal satisfactory results. She has been with this company for a long period of time. While her work is satisfactory, her assigned work were completed without any apparent improvements.",0
"There isn't really much to say about Alecia's work with our company. Since she was brought aboard, she has shown very little enthusiasm towards the position. She seems content with only doing the bare minimum. In fairness, she can be relied upon to do only what is asked of her. But outside of that, she isn't very proactive or does not show any traits that would suggest upward mobility, and I'm convinced that she would even be interested in growing her career with us.",0
"Esmerelda Langley has been an average performer this quarter. She has demonstrated moderate performance on the tasks that she has been given and an adequate skill set to meet the minimum requirements. Esmerelda has show low potential for growth and skill development moving forward in the company. She has the ability to be a good, not great worker with little room for improvement.",0
Isabella James is just here for the paycheck. She seems to have no interest in advancement or taking an active role in improving this company. She handles tasks efficiently if given detailed instruction. But her work seem to meet the minimum requirements.,0
"Esmealda Langley usually completes her work as assigned.  Esmeralda tries to meet her goals, and usually succeeds.  She is a nine to fiver and rarely goes beyond expectations.  I believe her lack of motivation to better the company is a detriment.",0
"Lance is a very standard worker. He always gets his work done on time and it is usually of sufficient quality. That being said he shows little to no desire to improve himself. Although his current work is consistently acceptable, he his little or no room for growth and is unlikely to improve past what he currently is.",0
"Esmeralda is always a reliable member to have on our team. She has excellent attention to detail and she can read client needs like a book. At the same time, her performance sometimes suffers just a little bit since she pays so much attention to detail that she often needs extra time to complete reports and thus misses some deadlines along the way. Unfortunately, I do not believe that she can really resolve this issue to a point where she can move up to the next level, because she is to detail-oriented to be able to let minor issues and insignificant mistakes go unaddressed.",0
"Peter works hard every day. I think he is ideally suited to the role that he is in - I am not sure how he would cope with a management role. However, he is a key part of the team and we are glad to have him.",0
"Aniya is a VERY good employee....but truthfully, I believe she has hit her peak.  I applaud her as an example. But if you want a true star in the company, find someone else.",0
"Aniya is an excellent worker in our department.  She meets all deadlines, her work is well done, and she is helpful and supportive of her coworkers.  She seems to have found her perfect fit here, as she is accomplished in her tasks and seems happy with her position.  She was not as successful when we attempted to give her advanced work to encourage her toward promotion.  Her abilities are best suited for her current position.",0
"Markus has is a high performer in his current position. He regularly attends to the duties of his job. He is a solid employee who can be counted on. However, he does not demonstrate great potential for advancement.",0
Jessica Dixon is a benefit to the team. What she lacks in talent she more than makes up for in hard work. She has an eye for detail and a touch for class. Overall it has been a joy to have her as part of the team.,0
"Benjamin is doing exceptionally well at his day-to-day tasks. His work definitely sets him apart from other employees. On the other hand, he doesn't show much capacity for improvement in areas outside of his job description. But otherwise his work is exemplary.",0
Eloise was an absolute pleasure to work with. She did great work and met all of her expectations. Unfortunately I did not see any room for growth. I believe she has maximized her ability within out department,0
"Eloise is quite reliable, and we can always count on her to go above and beyond. Yet, we also aren't really sure we see her going too high in the company, as she's best suited where she is. With that being said, we're quite fortunate to have Eloise. She is a real boon to the company.",0
"Leo is an absolutely necessary member to have on our team. We would not be able to produce half of the work that we produce without Leo since he probably does the work of about five people. I'm impressed by how adeptly, quickly and efficiently he churns out high-quality reports with sophisticated analysis. However, I don't see Leo advancing much further. He has no interest in taking on a leadership role and lacks the communication skills to be able to make it in a manager role.",0
"I'm always impressed by Braydon, since he performs like he has ten years of experience behind him even though he's only got five. He has a real eye for what clients want to see in reports and has a great sense of intuition for what the next steps on a client project are going to be. As much of a star as Braydon is, however, he hasn't shown any interest in mentoring younger colleagues and he isn't too much of a team player. Thus, I believe he doesn't have much room for promotion at this firm.",0
"Azariah is so talented in what she does and her writing ability is superb. She is incredibly creative in the storylines that she generates. Her advertising pitches consistently make it all the way to the big screen because clients are so routinely impressed with her work. At the same time, I think that Azariah is already performing at the highest level she can perform. She does not have what it takes to become an executive within our firm since she lacks the leadership ability to move up any further.",0
Azariah Mcmillan  has been an top rated employee in his work since the half year from he joined. He is interested in all aspects of projects doing it in a very dedicated manner and presenting it in a very stylish manner.,0
"Morgan is skilled, and her resume is impressive. Unfortunately, she seems to care less about her quality of work, and has become too involved in socialising with her colleagues. Her pace is often slow, and she rarely completes projects by deadlines. She will benefit from attending classes on time management. She may need to remove herself from current projects in order to catch up with those that are past deadlines.",0
Kyle is working toward gaining proficiency. Demonstrates satisfactory performance inconsistently. Achieves some but not all goals and is acquirring necessary knowledge and skills,0
SOPHIE MURRAY HAS BEEN SHOWING IRREGULAR PERFORMANCE IN MATCHES LATELY. HE EMPHASIS A LOW QUALITY PERFORMANCE .BUT HE DO HAVE A THE MODERATE TALENT WHICH CAN BE USED IN FUTURE. THERE ARE SOME SECTORS HE SHOULD IMPROVE. ONLY A GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT CAN ONLY BE EXPECTED FROM HIS SIDE. HE NEEDS TO LISTEN TO HIS COACH MORE OFTEN,0
"Kallie has struggled to find her footing at our company. She's repeatedly turned in work product containing typos, grammar issues, and content mistakes. The good thing is that I trust that Kallie will make great strides moving forward to improve. Every time I give her feedback or mark up documents for her, she takes my comments very seriously and always does better the next time. I believe she has the will and desire to become a reliable member of our department.",0
"Peter often shows up late at work. It has becoming a pattern. His assigned analysis report often shows his competence of data analysis and resourceful. However, sometimes there are some fundamental error were being overlooked resulting a re-do of such work. While he is a team player with adequate knowledge, the time management skills and attentiveness are yet to be improved.",0
"Amelie, you have demonstrated to us that you have the ability to perform at an acceptable standard. However, more effort needs to be exerted to improve your current performance. There are rooms for you to grow and expand. Consistent work ethics are needed in order for you to deliver better results. We believe that you do possess qualities that will make you successful.",0
"Tom is a promising candidate but lacks focus. Although Tom has shown his capabilities in short, sporadic bursts, his output has been bogged down by way too many distractions. He needs to bring his attention span in order and only then he will be able to realize his true potential. He can leverage various mindfulness techniques and training resources available free of cost to our employees. In short, we need Tom to work harder so that he can deliver value to businesses and clients alike.",0
"Jay is not off to a great start with us. He is consistently late, and hasn't really shown much aptitude for his duties. He does occasionally flash talent in other areas within his role. But in his current position it is quite clear that he has some room to improve.",0
"Mackenzie has room to improve. He has great potential and an impressive resume, but seems to lack the focus to excel. It's clear that he doesn't put more effort than he needs to; he tends to settle for bare minimum. This negatively affects the quality of his work. He works well alone, but does not work well in groups.",0
"Alfie has demonstrated he is not a team player. His ability to analyze data was mediocre in effort, however, there is some room for improvement. Alfie could benefit from being more cooperative and willing to collaborate with others. If he puts forth an attempt to learn the tasks better and listen to his co-workers, to I believe he may improve in performance.",0
"Alfie's quantitative skills simply are not up to par. Too often, a client has asked him to explain a basic equation and Alfie has needed to rely on colleagues for an answer. Fortunately, Alfie is committed to improving his math abilities and has signed up for a quantitative bootcamp and conference next month. I believe his attendance proves that he's being proactive about developing his skills and I further believe that his commitment will pay off in terms of advancement in this department.",0
"Jay Reid's level of work has been very disappointing given the kind of skills he possess. With the right attitude and possibly with a few work adjustments, his work quality could improve. Despite that, I am confident that once he fully adjusts and finds his direction, he will pay off. What the direction is he is still finding but whatever it is, his value is still there.",0
"Alfie is a very inconsistent worker. Right now he's not very competent and produces below average work most of the time. Normally I would suggest to remove him however he does show willingness to learn and improve. He learns from his mistakes and seeks feedback from his co-workers most of the time. Although he is not strong right now, he has the potential to improve to be a solid average worker.",0
"Ollie Mason repeatedly turns in work that is poorly researched with errors. Ollie does not participate in group meetings and has been caught on his phone many times. If Ollie would better manage his time both in and outside of the office, his work work improve as he lacks focus. His attendance is poor and he is frequently late. However, he is young and committed to the company for the long term and does not want to leave.",0
David was able to step into the Facility Management position with his feet on the ground.  He quickly learned the locations of emergency services and other important areas.  He has been seen with the clients and seems to have a good wokrkini relationship.  He neesds to improve coming ot wokr on time.,1
Braiden is a good entry level employee. He occasionally struggles to complete all of the tasks he is given but always asks questions. He is very engaged in meetings and is always on time to the office. He seeks opportunities often but still has a ways to go in order to develop his skill set. He can benefit from more time and mentorship in his current role.,1
"Heidi's work habits has been dismal, but there is great room for improvements, and she definitely has the ability to improve. She often spends the work day on her phone, and she completes assignments the day before they are due; however, the work that she submits is of the same standard of her colleagues', some of whom spent weeks generating the same results. Heidi rarely participates in team meetings, but when she does, she always brings new insight to the table. She should improve herself through listening to constructive criticism, and developing a self-betterment mindset.",1
Billy has shown good work ethic in his appraisal period. He was assigned numerous tasks and with guidance was able to complete the work on schedule. Billy does ask for assistance and guidance frequently so he should try to be more independent. Billy could possibly use some training in decision making.,1
"Bobby Lowe is an everyday paralegal here at the firm.  He is always on time, rarely calls out, and produces passable work product.  With that said, there is nothing extraordinary or distinguishable about Bobby's work; for instance, he generally follows basic templates and is rarely creative when drafting discovery requests.  His career ceiling seems fixed.",1
"Brynlee is a solid colleague who you can rely on to handle tasks of a standard difficulty level. I would advise against putting up for supervisory roles, however, she is excellent at what she does currently.",1
"Rebecca Murphy is good at her job and likely to get better. For this reason, I believe she is vital to the company now and will become even more important in the future. The company benefits from her presence here. She is also growing as a person because of her involvement will become better overall with time.",1
"Declan is a hardworking team member. His efforts sometimes fall short, regarding his lack of timeliness and schedule coordination. It seems that he has slacked off the longer he has worked here. However, he is well liked by his peers, and his work is quite acceptable.",1
"Kyle is a very middle-of-the-pack employee. He has shown average proficiency in his job duties. He also has shown some flashes that he could progress beyond his current role, but only minor ones. His numbers are also at or near the median amongst the rest of his employees. Overall, I would say he's average at best and at worst.",1
Joseph Burke is a core player in our organization. He achieves everything in time and usually in budget. He is following the policies and knows the procedures. Probably he can be that innovative or proactive but he can keep things going.,1
"Tom is reliable and consistent. He puts in the standard time, gets his work done, and on-time. He doesn't go above and beyond, but he's been a reliable resource for completing busy-work tasks, without a ton of supervision or following up. Year over year, Tom has improved gradually taking on a little more.",1
Edward has great ideas that he offers to the team. Edward has few areas that he could work on to improve himself. Edward doesn't always want to be working when he needs to be. Edward could be a key employee to this company if he put in the work.,1
Sonny doesn't give this job her full potential and seems to be distracted often. When she is on her A game she brings it to the team. Sonny could improve in being more consistent. Sonny has future here if she continueings to work hard.,1
"Amaya can generally be relied upon to submit work product that's of reasonable quality. She doesn't make many mistakes and her proofreading is fairly spot-on. However I have caught a few typos and spelling errors here and there. When I've pushed Amaya to take on more challenging research assignments, she's refused, so I believe she has unfortunately met her maximum capacity at this company already.",1
"Kyle has shown somewhat improvement in this quarter. Although, I am sure he can do a lot better. He is doing more hard work than before, which is appreciable. He has way to go to learn the basic, that would improve his efficiency and performance.",1
"Kyle is a middle-of-the-pack employee all around. He has demonstrated solid performance when given the opportunity. He has also shown some capacity for growth and improvement. Overall, he's a solid member of this organization with some decent potential for improvement later on.",1
"Employee is able to overcome challenges while regularly communicating needs with management. This greatly improves not only employee and management morale/relationship but also employee to employee moral/relationship. Able to easily transition from worker to educator, showing a desire for movement within company. Work is always done on time and accurately which is evident in her work and assistance with other employees.",1
Pedro David works hard. I once seen him work 12 hours a day just to finish a project. He is never late and always finish on time. He is very careful with his work and have good potential.,1
Rachel Turner is what we like to call the engine of the room. She can finish tasks in minutes and shows great promise. We are hoping in time her talent will show further. At present we are impressed with the strategical hard work she is showing.,1
"Perdo David produces tasks efficiently and timely. Pedro excels in meeting his numbers each quarter. Since Pedro is already operating at a high capacity, he has little to improve on things that he is already doing a great job at.",1
Angelica Peterson is one of the great performer in our office. She is very intelligent. She has lots of talent though she should improve some accuracy and punctual in her career. May she will reach more heights soon.,1
"Regan Rhodes has proven their work to be exemplary. Though we greatly enjoy the Rhodes' puts out, we feel there could be more of an effort to go beyond their current position. Should Rhodes show a desire to improve upon their skill set and increased responsibility, we would be very happy to accommodate that. We hope to see Rhodes have continued success in their endeavors with us, and will strive to improve upon their work ethic.",1
"It's such an absolute pleasure to work with Angelica. Her mind is so creative and the business strategies that she comes up with are so cutting-edge. Sometimes her ideas aren't practical enough to implement, however, which is going to limit her prospects for promotion somewhat. But we've discussed keeping her ideas within budget and within reason and she's committed to try to do so, so I'm confident she can make some improvements in this area.",1
Dallas is doing an exceptional job with us. He works hard and efficiently and his numbers show it. He also has shown some capacity for taking on more and possibly growing within the organization. But his strengths clearly lie in the work her does.,1
"In regards to EloiseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quarterly work conduct, she has shown a great sign of her job fulfillment. There has definitely been improvement on her part of her workflow and duties. She can get the job done swiftly and without any rebuke. There is a part of her that can show some advancement on what can possibly do in the future if there is a high job position available for her. She needs to understand that she prospect of becoming an even better worker if she can see herself do it.",1
"Finley Gray has been an asset to our company as he always completes tasks as assigned to him.  As soon as Mr Gray gets to work he begins his day, he is never idle.  Finley works until his job is complete and is proud of his results. Finley is detail oriented and also makes sure his assignments are completed perfectly.",1
"David kelly is a hard working man  .Eventhough he has moderate potential his performance is really great.
He always shows perfection in his job. He sincerely does his projects",1
Madison Hawkins continuously goes above and beyond in her job duties. She repeatedly assists co-workers while taking initiative for projects. Her work has very few errors but she does not do well in leadership roles. Madison can improve her potential by working on her public speaking and confidence. Madison is always early and is able to handle a heavier work load than other workers.,1
I need you to try harder. You have a lot of potential here but you just aren't stepping up to the potential. You need to come and want to work. The more effort you give the better you will be off at this company and the more money you will make in the future. Go get 'em,1
"When Jayden turns in her projects, I am sure the work will be not only spectacular but correct. I never have to worry about whether or not the task is done correctly. My ongoing concern is whether the job will be done at all. I see in her natural intelligence and ability, I don't see any drive.",1
"Erin has proven that she has a love for what she does, but doesn't push herself. Her performance is low, but the work that she does turn in has so much potential. I want to see Erin thrive, and really push herself. I want to find what her roadblock is, and break through it. I want to see Erin really explore and utilize her potential within this company.",1
"George didn't deliver as well as hoped. However, he displays a great deal of all skills necessary for growth. With time, George will prove to be an asset to the company. Given the opportunity, George has the ability to advance beyond his given skill set.",1
"Kallie right now is in an interesting position. She is performing really poorly, not meeting deadlines, and generally produces low quality work. However, she has given an incredible amount of effort into improving herself and learning from her mistakes. She always responds well to feed back and proactively seeks to improve herself. Although she is isn;t doing well now, she will definitely improve with experience.",1
"Clay is a boy concerned about his grades and his personal life.  it fulfills its activities although not all are of the best quality,  it all depends on your dedication in each assignment and subject it all depends on his dedication in each assignment and  subject when he sets out to do so, however he has never missed any class",1
"Clay's performance is ok, but the potential is there to do much better. He seems a bit unmotivaed and lazy at times, but when the other workers get going, he normally performs in the top earning position. He does not do this all the time though. Only when other workers are around and when they get going. It's almost like Clay likes to compete, but only when others are activley competing too. Otherwise, he is not a very good performer.",1
"Nicole has shown so much growth this past quarter. She continues to hit her goals, and continue to take on new ones. I want to see Nicole continue to grow with our company, and take on new roles and opportunities. I look forward to seeing where Nicole goes within our company, as she is a great asset!",1
"Joe demonstrates stellar potential for the future. This quarter, he produced a report for me that needed some revisions, and his report went through multiple rounds of editing. However, I am confident that he has the ability to take my feedback and incorporate it into his future work product with much less guidance and assistance. Joe is ambitious and has the skills necessary to take his analysis skills to the next level.",1
"Owen is a trusty member of the team and I really appreciate how he always takes the time to review younger colleagues' work for them. I know that people around here trust his judgment and advice, and their work is always better once he's taken a look at it. Though Owen sometimes slips up here and there with the occasional missed deadline I believe that his future is really bright at this firm. He has everything that it takes to become a partner since he is so committed to improving every day, and since he is such a recognized leader by his colleagues.",1
"Yahir is a solid worker who possesses a high capacity for growth in our organization. His numbers are slightly above average, and he has shown that he is capable and proficient in his current duties. However, his attitude and enthusiasm for the job really set him apart. Also, his lengthy experience and leadership skills are talents that we would be wise to leverage so that he can be successful here.",1
Yahir shows good potential in his job performance. I believe that he can move up in this company if he continues to improve. Yahir is polite and respectful to his co workers. Yahir is a great addition to this team.,1
"Kallie has been with the company for a year now. While her execution of some of her tasks has been hit or miss, she does show a lot of promise. She has been willing to work late and come in early to learn various aspects she needs help on. She should make solid improvement with her job execution over the next year given her work ethic and drive.",1
"Although Brantley's work may not always show it, I believe that he possesses a great deal of raw talent and a number of intangibles that could make him a star player at some point in the future. In addition to his strong attitude, he has shown an aptitude for working well with others and learning new things quickly. It might not always show in his results, but he is at least trying hard and putting in effort. I think that with a bit more consistency in his results, he could grow into a prominent role at this organization.",1
"Kayleigh has been a joy to have around the workspace. She consistently performs with an upbeat personality and drive that leads me to believe she'll find great success here. Her work quality has varied over her last several tasks, but I do not expect this to be an issue for long. Her hard-working personality and passion for the field lead me to believe we'll see even more improvements very soon.",1
"I had an opportunity to work with Deegan Dennis on few project last year. I found him creative and quick learner. If he is given new opportunities, he will be able to complete effectively. He just need a little push and training to be best performer in coming year.",1

Emilie is an inspiration to us all, lets hope we can all follow in her footsteps!",1
"Madison has shown leadership, initiative, and can-do spirit. She is hard working, sharp witted, and always strive her best to deliver the best possible work. She is always willing to go extra miles. Of all of the work she has done,  she has done with efficiency, great dedication and intelligence. All of our customers are raving about her.",1

"Candidate performed well, and ranked highly amongst her peers. I believe the candidate to have great potential, and look forward to working with them in the future. I would recommend further reading into Econometrics to have achieved the full 10 marks. Otherwise, well done.",1
"Gunnar is one of the best we have in the company. Friendly and professional demeanour that immediately puts customers at ease, matched by his very high output. Not only is he well versed in the day to day work, he definitely sees the overarching objectives of the company.

# Recruitment_rep
The program will show the percentage of relevance of a future employee in the field of IT, based on his data, passed testing and letter of recommendation.

# Description
The relevance of this work lies in the importance of using artificial intelligence in modern industries that are not related to the Information Technology industry. At the moment, artificial intelligence is used in almost all areas: in medicine, finance and commerce, industry, and ensuring order and security - wherever you need to process large amounts of data, systematize and predict. The field of recruiting is no exception, modern recruiters, whose duties include processing a huge amount of data for recruitment, also use artificial intelligence, which makes their work easier.
The purpose of this work is to automate recruiter functions using machine learning and natural language processing.
The following development tools were used:
- Programming language "Python 3" including "Tensorflow", "Pandas" and "NumPy" modules.
- "Google Colab" as an IDE.
- "MS Excel" for creating and containing large amounts of data.

# How to run the project
To start, load the "Main.ipynb" in your Google Drive, after open it via Google Colab.
Run first cell and load all csv files from your PC to Google Colab. CSV files are required for training and testing neural networks.
Run the second cell and wait until the neural network is trained.
Enter your data and pass the test, then run the third cell. The program will show your mistakes, then the percentage of your relevance.
You can then add your letter of recommendation and launch the fourth cell. The program will tell you if your letter of recommendation is good or not.
In the end you can check the prediction rate of your recommendation letter (rate higher than 0 is considered well) and the accuracy of neural networks.

# How to use the project
THIS PROJECT IS CREATED FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE USED TO EVALUATE REAL EMPLOYEES, because it's not entirely accurate!
In spite of what was said above, in my opinion this project has potential.

# How to improve the project
Just because this project was done in a short time by myself, there are many things to improve in it, for example, the average accuracy of the NLP model is 70%, which is considered not bad, but not good either (the performance of modern NLP models is above 95%). Also the test part is quite small. In conclusion, it would be great if this project had an interactive graphical interface.
